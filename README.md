# TEx: Text Expander Python Application
// this application is in Beta version currently //

Text Expander is a very useful tool to have\
you can save time by typing few letters and it automatically turns it into the link, text, emoji, or whatever you want\
and here is a very simple application with TKinter & Keyboard.

## Requirements

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```Bash
pip install customtkinter pillow pystray keyboard
```
I will add more features in the future\
I wanna add more pages, and better prefix management, better UI maybe\
and most importantly I want to add more default pages
